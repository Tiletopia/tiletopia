# === APP-PLANNING ===
## notes and homestead tile example 
<Tile 
    id="A1"
    tileId='1'  
    tileName="Homestead" 
    baseTileCost="5" 
    upgradeCost={baseCost*50} 
    buyAnotherItem={baseCost*25}
    collectAfterSeconds="10" 
    baseEarnings="5" 
    isUnlocked
    upgradeLevel="1"
    itemCount="1"
>

## locked tile class
- if this.props.isUnlocked = true/false (boolean)
    - this.props.isUnlocked ? className=" HomeStead" : className=" Locked"

## only buy tile if tile to the left is unlocked
- check tile id-1 is unlocked                                           <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<
    - document.getelementbyid("A1") check if prop.isUnlocked
- list of unlocked tiles ?
    - state= unlockedTiles = { {A: [1,2,3]}, {B: [1,2,3]}}

# === BASE TASKS / MVP ===
- login/authentication (DB)
- save game (DB)
    - save state
        - tileStateArray? get states from each tile (save what tiles are unlocked, upgradeLevel, itemCount etc... )

- locked tile class

- buy a tile
    - first tile free - makes 5 coins every 10 seconds
    - `<Tile baseTileCost="5" >`
    - onclick check `totalCurrency > baseTileCost && `
        - if : unlock tile and start incrementing
        - else : alert (for now) "not enough money!"

- earn money
    - pull from tiles timer  
    - `<Tile collectAfterSeconds="10">` 
    - increment total currency (state)
        - >> passive collect <<
        - click to collect

- buy another tile

- upgrade a tile
    - `baseTileCost * 50`
    - decrease `collectAfterSeconds` - decrease by 2 seconds
    - `<Tile upgradeLevel="1">`
    - **how to track upgradeLevel?**                                    <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<  
    
- number of items owned (buying another homestead on homestead tile)
    - `baseTileCost * 25`
    - increase earnings ( `<Tile baseEarnings="5">` ) - increase by 5 coins (baseEarnings * 5)
    - **how to track itemCount?**                                    <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<  


## stretch-goals

- tileRowId="A" & tileColumnId='1'
    - row - era - ABC
    - column - tile - 123
- multiple rows
- choose avatar?
